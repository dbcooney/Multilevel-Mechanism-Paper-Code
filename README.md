# Code for "Assortment and Reciprocity Mechanisms for Promotion of Cooperation in a Model of Multilevel Selection"

This repository accompanies the preprint "Assortment and Reciprocity Mechanisms for Promotion of Cooperation in a Model of Multilevel Selection", by Daniel B. Cooney. It includes all of the scripts used to generate the figures in the paper.

The repository is organized into two folders: Scripts and Figures. All of the scripts can be run using Python 2.7.

For reference, below is a list of the figures from the paper and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.
